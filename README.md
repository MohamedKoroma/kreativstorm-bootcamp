## 📜 Certificate Summary

During this 4-week intensive hands-on cybersecurity bootcamp, I worked through real-world labs, completed technical challenges, and used professional tools to gain practical experience in offensive and defensive techniques across key areas of modern cyber defense and ethical hacking.

- Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)
- Packet capture and network traffic analysis
- Web application security testing
- Python scripting for security automation
- Cryptographic principles
- Security reporting and documentation

### 🔑 Key Learning Areas:
- **Conducted end-to-end Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** using industry tools and reporting frameworks.
- **Analyzed network traffic and packet data** with Wireshark and Tcpdump to detect anomalies, inspect protocols, and interpret attack patterns.
- **Performed web application testing** using Burp Suite, testing for injection flaws, authentication issues, and insecure configurations.
- **Executed command-line driven security operations** within Kali Linux, including reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation techniques.
- **Wrote Python scripts** to automate basic tasks such as log parsing, IP filtering, and simulated brute-force detection.
- **Applied cryptographic principles** in simulated data protection tasks, gaining foundational understanding of hashing, encryption, and secure key handling.
- **Used Visual Studio Code** as an IDE for script development and documentation, integrating it with Kali tools and file operations.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔍 [Burp Suite Web Vulnerability Scan Demo](./burp-suite-scan/burp_scan_report.md)
Simulated a real-world scan on a deliberately vulnerable website using Burp Suite. The report includes:
- Scope configuration
- Discovered vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
- Screenshots of key analysis
- Summary of methodology and findings

➡️ **Skills demonstrated**: Web app security, input validation analysis, threat classification, and secure testing methodology.

### 🐍 [Python Script – Failed Login IP Blocker](./python-ip-blocker/README.md)
Built a Python script to parse server logs and detect brute force login attempts. IPs exceeding a failed login threshold are written to a blocklist.

➡️ **Skills demonstrated**: Python scripting, regex filtering, log analysis, basic IDS simulation, and automation for defensive security.
